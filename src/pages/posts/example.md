# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of web development and what you need to know to get started.

## HTML - The Foundation

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every website. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## CSS - Making it Beautiful

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) helps us style our HTML content:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}
```
